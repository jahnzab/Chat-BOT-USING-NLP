# Chat-BOT-USING-NLP
<h1>Overview</h1>
<br>
<p>This project implements a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is designed to understand user intents and provide appropriate responses based on predefined patterns and responses. It utilizes the nltk library for natural language processing, scikit-learn for machine learning, and streamlit for creating an interactive web interface.</p>
<br>
<b><h1>Features</h1><b/>
  <br>
<p>
    Understands various user intents such as greetings, farewells, gratitude, and more.
    Provides relevant responses based on user input.
    Maintains a conversation history that can be viewed by the user.
    Built using Python and leverages popular libraries for NLP and machine learning.
</p>
<br>
<b><h1>Technologies Used</h1><b/>
<br>
<p>
    Python
    NLTK
    Scikit-learn
    Streamlit
    JSON for intents data
</p>
<br>
<h1>Usage</h1>
<br>
<p>To run the chatbot application, execute the following command:</p>
<br>
<p>streamlit run app.py</p>
<h1>Intents Data</h1>
<br>
<p>The chatbot's behavior is defined by the intents.json file, which contains various tags, patterns, and responses. You can modify this file to add new intents or change existing ones.
</p>
  <br>
  <h1>Conversation History<h1/>
<p>The chatbot saves the conversation history in a CSV file (chat_log.csv). You can view past interactions by selecting the "Conversation History" option in the sidebar.</p>
